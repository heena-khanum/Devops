Overview of Build Automation Tools, key differences between Maven and Gradle, Installation and
Setup.
Build Automation Tools:
 1. Apache Maven
• Config file: pom.xml (XML-based)
• Philosophy: Convention over configuration
• Dependency management: Built-in via Maven Central
• Ideal for: Java projects, enterprise applications
Pros:
• Widely used and standardized
• Strong IDE support (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
Cons:
• XML can be verbose
• Less flexible for custom workflows
 2. Gradle
• Config file: build.gradle (Groovy) or build.gradle.kts (Kotlin DSL)
• Philosophy: Flexible, modern build system
• Dependency management: Maven/Ivy compatible
• Ideal for: Java, Kotlin, Android, multi-language builds
Pros:
• Faster builds with daemon and incremental support
• Highly customizable scripting
Cons:
• More complex to learn initially
 3. Apache Ant
• Config file: build.xml (XML-based)
• Philosophy: Scripted automation
• Dependency management: None built-in (use Ivy)
• Ideal for: Older/legacy projects
Pros:
• Flexible for custom build tasks
Cons:
• Outdated, verbose, manual dependency management
 4. Make / GNU Make
• Config file: Makefile
• Philosophy: Rule-based build process
• Used in: C/C++, low-level or cross-platform projects
Pros:
• Simple and powerful
• Works well in Unix environments
Cons:
• Not native to Java
• Not dependency-aware like Gradle/Maven
 5. Bazel (by Google)
• Config files: BUILD, WORKSPACE
• Philosophy: Fast, scalable builds for monorepos
• Used in: Google-scale codebases
Pros:
• Excellent caching, parallelism
• Language-agnostic
Cons:
• Complex to set up
• Less community support than Maven/Gradle
 Key differences between Maven and Gradle:
Feature Maven Gradle
Language XML Groovy/Kotlin DSL
Performance Slower Faster (incremental)
Flexibility Limited High
Learning Curve Easier for beginners Steeper for beginners
Android Support Limited First-class
Maven Installation:
(Note: better to use java 17 version)
Update java:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
java –version
sudo apt update
sudo apt install maven -y
mvn --version
Note: if need latest version
wget https://downloads.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.tar.gz
Gradle installation:
Ensure your system has Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Gradle requires Java 8 or later.
Check if Java is installed:
(Note: better to use java 17 version)
Update java:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
java --version
If not installed, install OpenJDK:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
Gradle installation steps:
option 1:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gradle -y
(Note: Better to prefer option 2 )
option 2:
Download the latest Gradle binary:
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.6-bin.zip
Extract and move it to /opt/gradle/:
sudo mkdir /opt/gradle
sudo unzip gradle-8.6-bin.zip -d /opt/gradle
sudo ln -s /opt/gradle/gradle-8.6 /opt/gradle/latest
Set up environment variables:
echo "export PATH=/opt/gradle/latest/bin:\$PATH" | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
source /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
Verify:
gradle -v
